# EnableGuessr

Educational mini game based on GeoGuessr. Users are presented with different pages of the Enable platform with all the text turned off. They then have to guess which page they are on, gaining points based on the speed and accuracy of their answer. 

## General idea

Collect and store many pictures of the Enable platform sans text, name each one based on something recognizable. My best idea at the moment is to use the title text that's on each screen, although this can change. []

Store each picture along with it's answer in a json file. [X]

Build a basic layout with displays the image [X]

Build logic to load the image, as well as a next action [X]

Add the ability to guess, including correct and incorrect guesses []

Add a scoring system []

Add a lives system or equivalent, along with a game over screen []
